For over two decades Chashama has played a central role in sustaining New York’s vibrant artistic community by giving space to 20,000 artists, hosting 4,000 public art events, providing 1,500 free art classes in under-resourced communities, and reaching an audience of nearly a million. Chashama was founded in 1995 by Artistic Director Anita Durst to remedy what she observed to be the greatest threat artists faced: the lack of affordable space. Since its inception Chashama has worked collaboratively with artists, property owners, and the New York community to activate space and support under-resourced communities, establishing itself as a well-regarded cultural force on a mission to increase access to the arts for all.\nAbout NYC Fair Trade Coalition:\nThe NYC Fair Trade Coalition is a grassroots organization that promotes fair trade businesses and retailers in New York City and educates consumers on the importance of fair trade.
